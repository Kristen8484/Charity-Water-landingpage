            When communities gain access to clean and safe drinking water, time is returned to families, health improves,
            and students get back to class. Your support funds proven solutions—like wells and piped systems—with transparent reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we can bring clean water to more people—one project at a time.
